Our objectives are twofold:\n","\n","\n","1.   Perform Masked Language Modeling (MLM) on the training portion of provided dataset.\n","2.   Construct a classifier to discern between positive and negative reviews.\n","\n","To achieve these goals, we employ a customized smaller version of BERT.

The objective of MLM is to encourage the model to learn contextual relationships between words and understand the overall structure and semantics of the language. During training, the model receives input sequences with masked tokens and is trained to generate the correct tokens for the masked positions. MLM serves as a crucial pre-training step in learning rich contextual representations of words, which can be transferred to downstream tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering.\n","![](https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/22971fig-3.png)\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xo7Bb0ckvobA"},"source":["## 1.1 Dateset preparation for MLM"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":113,"referenced_widgets":["504516305a7240d9ae77c63b1fd2ee63","a38ca034457f4d3fb174f40f6e322b8d","9c3c96518c434ba7994962385dce641d","6d2fbc23343240c081e3f849ccc149ab","cfd61291f67641939e499de178c1a9da","db9af34120d14b15bcfb81625fe53b3d","83e6060b43ba4e468172a8132578ab93","55ca244dfdf747f78d953b9bf45a0880","bb44e858ec07458eb9a56d5c6653c36d","f8300a05a91f44da9872cea1f6aa6094","d580c7751be248b1a0c33fc9416d3abc","97b63cb1ff994914ba2507e3db8f84d2","f264fb9e41d44c88849b7e19ff0533cc","8d5058923384454fb80af55f605a9c64","6d75e8608543437b9e3f46918046998f","c87ac43976d048be835f5a9bcbd86c4c","c23802def65f42e6b129ee188d8e6b75","6f6b5ba6ee7d49509906a24f7f04f6f9","3e02148262444272a830a5f7e62f366a","03f42eae10e049fc8cf5675eab39902b","cb4d9762cbdf4695a73ab8bf0691df35","d301489db1fb45728c91f994a7338218","6719fb5fc0914445b70d9d81bd9117fc","c2ad6f901d9b4a13b68e905cd313126c","01d0039414384ac78e57111ff3d0ea95","0cb96e1945df401bb1834b3b3259b1da","d4cbce6d351d41a4acdb354367c65ab1","614ea731eafb43aca8288d61b9ae8808","b6e677bed1514b77aeb2da9f91b2981a","d0c4078aa2fb43cf814e90e69fa71ed9","82574cf4685949bdafdd6721e5cfe6c3","879086f9835248d0991e8a0c9dceed87","66722f4c693645fbb5c9b47ab3883d30"]},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-11T21:48:03.209684Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-11T21:48:03.209397Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.072107Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.071300Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-11T21:48:03.209652Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14771,"status":"ok","timestamp":1711623040615,"user":{"displayName":"mehran sarmadi","userId":"05713412677971440691"},"user_tz":-210},"id":"40b7cb3f-08f6-4a05-8cc5-542076798680","outputId":"8740e6ba-531d-41cc-a364-0f1fe8a403d8","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define a function to preprocess text data for masked language modeling (MLM)\n","def mlm_map_function(rows):\n","    # Tokenize the text with specified tokenizer parameters\n","    input_info = tokenizer(rows['text'], max_length=128, padding=\"max_length\", truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n","    return {\n","        **input_info,\n","        'labels': input_info['input_ids']\n","        }\n","\n","# Apply the mlm_map_function to the dataset for masked language modeling (MLM)\n","mlm_dataset = dataset.map(mlm_map_function, batched=True, num_proc=2, remove_columns=dataset['train'].column_names)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.073457Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.073152Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.078841Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.077932Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.073431Z"},"id":"8oEREo8XwD4-","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling from transformers\n","from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n","\n","# Create a data collator for MLM training\n","collate_fn = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n","    tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=True, mlm_probability=0.15\n",")\n","\n","# Create a DataLoader for MLM training\n","train_dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(\n","    mlm_dataset[\"train\"], collate_fn=collate_fn, batch_size=batch_size\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"R5vhcoIzwxgN"},"source":["## 1.2 BertModel + MLMHead + Custom trainer"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.080307Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.080049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.093902Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.093087Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-11T21:48:05.080285Z"},"id":"LOz0RzCtdlNH","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["class MLMHead(nn.Module):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head for Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","        bert_model (torch.nn.Module): BERT model.\n","        hidden_size (int): Size of the hidden layers in the MLP head.
